- Integration with Medusa.js authentication system
- Secure session management with Redis
- Password hashing using bcrypt (cost factor 12)

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Extended customer table
ALTER TABLE customer ADD COLUMN company_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE customer ADD COLUMN phone_validated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE customer ADD COLUMN account_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'business';
ALTER TABLE customer ADD COLUMN last_login_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Customer addresses (leverage Medusa's address system)
-- Enhanced with Mexican-specific validation
```

### Security Features
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CSRF protection for forms
- Secure cookie configuration
- Input validation and sanitization

### Mexican Market Compliance
- Mexican phone number format validation
- Data collection consent per LFPDPPP
- Privacy notice in Spanish
- Right to data deletion capability

## Definition of Done

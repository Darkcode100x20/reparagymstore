# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

**Story ID:** REP-STORY-1.1  
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Authentication & Account Management  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Days 1-7)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Assignee:** Backend Developer  

## User Story

**As a** development team  
**I want to** set up the basic project infrastructure  
**So that** we can begin building the ReparagymStore application on a solid foundation  

## Business Context

This story establishes the technical foundation for the entire ReparagymStore project. Without proper infrastructure setup, no development work can proceed. This includes the core technology stack implementation and basic deployment pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Medusa.js Backend Deployment
- [ ] Medusa.js backend application created and configured
- [ ] Backend deployed to Railway staging environment
- [ ] Environment variables configured securely
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding correctly
- [ ] Admin dashboard accessible at staging URL

### AC2: PostgreSQL Database Configuration
- [ ] PostgreSQL database provisioned (Neon or Railway)
- [ ] Database connection established from backend
- [ ] Initial Medusa schema migrated successfully
- [ ] Database backup configuration enabled
- [ ] Connection pooling configured for performance

### AC3: Redis Cache Configuration
- [ ] Redis instance provisioned for session management
- [ ] Redis connection established from backend
- [ ] Session storage functionality tested
- [ ] Cache configuration optimized for ReparagymStore use case
- [ ] Redis monitoring and alerting setup

### AC4: Next.js Frontend Connection
- [ ] Next.js frontend application created
- [ ] Frontend connected to Medusa backend API
- [ ] Basic routing structure implemented
- [ ] Frontend deployed to Vercel staging environment
- [ ] Environment variables configured for API communication

### AC5: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline for backend
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline for frontend
- [ ] Staging deployment automation working
- [ ] Build notifications configured

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Medusa.js 2.0+ with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ with connection pooling
- **Cache:** Redis 7+ for sessions and caching
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Deployment:** Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend)

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
// Backend environment variables
interface BackendEnv {
  DATABASE_URL: string;
  REDIS_URL: string;
  MEDUSA_ADMIN_CORS: string;
  STORE_CORS: string;
  JWT_SECRET: string;
  COOKIE_SECRET: string;
}

// Frontend environment variables  
interface FrontendEnv {
  NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL: string;
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: string;
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
}
```

### Infrastructure Setup Checklist
- [ ] Railway project created for backend
- [ ] Vercel project created for frontend  
- [ ] Domain configuration prepared
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Monitoring tools setup (health checks, error tracking)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed and verified
- [ ] Backend application accessible via staging URL
- [ ] Frontend application accessible via staging URL
- [ ] Database migrations running successfully
- [ ] Redis session storage functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline executing without errors
- [ ] Health checks passing for all services
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured
- [ ] Basic monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Backend API health check responds correctly
- [ ] Database connection stability tested
- [ ] Redis session creation and retrieval tested
- [ ] Frontend-backend API communication tested
- [ ] Environment variable access tested

### Non-Functional Testing
- [ ] Backend response time < 500ms for health checks
- [ ] Database connection pool performance tested
- [ ] Redis connection performance tested
- [ ] Frontend build time < 2 minutes
- [ ] Deployment pipeline completion < 5 minutes

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies
- GitHub repository access and permissions
- Railway account setup and payment method
- Vercel account setup and team access
- Domain registration and DNS configuration

### External Services Required
- Railway hosting service
- Vercel hosting service
- Neon PostgreSQL or Railway database
- Redis hosting (Railway or external provider)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Service Provider Outages:** Implement monitoring and have backup plans
- **Configuration Errors:** Use Infrastructure as Code where possible

### Medium Risk
- **Environment Variable Management:** Use secure secret management
- **Database Migration Issues:** Test migrations thoroughly in staging

### Low Risk
- **Build Pipeline Failures:** Implement proper error handling and retries

## Post-Story Tasks

### Immediate Follow-up
- Configure monitoring dashboards
- Set up error tracking and alerting
- Create developer onboarding documentation
- Establish development workflow guidelines

### Future Considerations
- Production environment preparation
- Performance optimization baseline
- Security hardening implementation
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
